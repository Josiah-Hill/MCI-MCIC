## MCI-MCIC
**An ML project examining a potential opportunity for arbitrage in the stock market.**

### Motivation

In 2001, Michael Rashes published an article in the Journal of Finance that identified a potential arbitrage opportunity in the stock market. He identified two stocks, Massmutual Corporate Investors (MCI) and MCI Communications (MCIC) that had very similar trading patterns, despite being in completely unrelated fields. The purpose of this project is to investigate the rest of the market using the framework put forth by Rashes. 

### Results
The results indicate that the market is approximately normally distributed in regards to this issue, which supports the hypothesis that the opportunity identified by Rashes is anomalous in a wider market view.

### Data Source
Stock data is accessed through the [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) package.
